# Anthony Rice - Individual Project

This repository will serve as Anthony Rice's Individual project (Lab Pal) for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

### Problem Statement

I used to work at a contract laboratory as a project manager and most of my project tracking was performed on either Microsoft Excel or OneNote.  Since myself and other project managers managed their projects in a similar manner, I figured it would be beneficial to create a web application instead to track this information.

Tracking Items: Clients, Methods, Samples, Tests, etc.
